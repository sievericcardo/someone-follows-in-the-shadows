# Someone follows in the shadows

Someone follows in the shadows is a game developed for the "bored pixel jam" using the Godot game engine.
The team was composed as follow:

- @shevaara was the 2d artist
- Luca for the level design
- @limbiclimbo for the music

and I was in charge of the game development and the programming part.
As of now the artist files and the music have not been uploaded due to privacy rights.
